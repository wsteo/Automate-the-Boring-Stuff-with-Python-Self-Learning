1. What is []?
[] is an empty list.

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a
variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
To assign the value 'hello', I would use spam[2] = 'hello'

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
The answer is d

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
d

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
['a', 'b']

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].
6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
+ and =

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
append() will only add the value at the end of the list, insert() can be used to insert the value to the targeted index

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
- del TARGET_LIST[index]
- list.remove()

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
- list values are mutables

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
the values in lists are mutables, meanwhile tuples are immutables

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
(42)

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
for tuple, cast it to a list. list(())
for list, cast it to a tuple. tuple([])

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
id for the reference

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
copy.copy() one the first layer of the list, copy.deepcopy() will copy all the layer of the list.
